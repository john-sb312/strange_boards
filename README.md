Embedded devices dumping
========================

Some embedded devices i've got my hands on. Everything except G-97RG6m and that weird TV Box with a cheap Sigma SMP8673B from FPT were dumped their SPI Flash using Ch341a USB and a SOIC-8 clip. Careful with the voltage output by these USBs as there were faulty batch that output 5V even on 3.3V pins.
