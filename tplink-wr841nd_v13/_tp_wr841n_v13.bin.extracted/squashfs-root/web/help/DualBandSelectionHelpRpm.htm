<h1 class="header">Dual Band Selection Help</h1>
<p class="brief">The internet setting is finished, please choose the wireless band of the router.</p>
<p class="advantages"><B>Advantages of 5GHz:</B></p>
<p class="s_0"> The 5GHz band is less likely to be congested. The 2.4GHz frequency range is much more prone to interference, as it is commonly used by other wireless networks in the area, as well as cordless phones, garage door openers and other home appliances and consumer products.</p>
<p class="disadvantages"><B>Disadvantages of 5GHz:</B></p>
<p class="s_1"> In general, the higher the frequency of a wireless signal, the shorter its range. Thus, 2.4GHz networks cover a substantially larger range than 5GHz wireless networks. In particular, the higher frequency wireless signals of 5GHz networks do not penetrate solid objects nearly as well as 2.4GHz signals, limiting their reach inside homes.</p>
